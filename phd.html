                <p><i>Aerography</i> – from Greek <i>aēr</i> 'air' + <i>-graphia</i> 'writing' – reimagines the concept of air quality beyond numerical indices, contributing to recent research on air and atmospheres across the humanities, arts, and social sciences. Air quality normally refers to quantitative measures of air pollution calibrated against local, regional, and international standards. Limit values have become central to monitoring and regulation practices, but they cannot fully account for the complex and uneven burden of toxicity that emerges and accumulates through intimate relations of bodies and atmospheres. The aim of <i>Aerography</i> is to to propose ways of generating relational, situated, and polyvocal accounts of air quality via participatory arts, exhibition design, art-science collaboration, and interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>

                <h2 id="why-aerography">Why aerography?</h2>
                <p> Aerography is an emerging realm of theories and practices for making air, atmospheres, and breathing palpable, personal, poetic, or perhaps political. Once a field of atmospheric science in the early 1900s, the term ‘aerography’ has in recent years been revived by researchers spanning multiple disciplines across the arts and humanities.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1068/d2903ed" target="_blank">[3]</a> Aerographers study atmospheric conditions in relation to social, cultural, and historical phenomena. Broadly speaking, aerography implies the possibility of writing the air as opposed to the earth in geography. The <i>aero-</i> here may refer to aesthetic and material qualities of the air as well as the experience of being immersed in an atmosphere. While the <i>graphia</i> or writing action refers to processes for transcribing, narrating, or sounding said qualities and experiences.</p>

                <p>This project was completed at the UCL Department of Geography, University College London. Research began in 2020, at the height of Covid-19 and #icantbreathe activism, when breathable air was politically and experientially at stake. Fieldwork became possible once quarantines lifted, starting in the UK via arts collaborations and ethnographic study in Oxford and London respectively. This was followed by a research visit at the University of Alicante, fieldwork in Andalusia, and an artist residency at the University of Bern. Each case study situates concerns about air pollution within a political, cultural, and social context.</p>

                <p>This research was supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts. It was supervised by Professor Andrew Barry (UCL Department of Geography) and Professor Joy Sleeman (Slade School of Fine Art). The examiners were Professor Peg Rawes (The Bartlett School of Architecture) and Professor Andreas Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos (Westminster Law and Theory Lab). The viva voce exam took place on October 4, 2024 and the result was pass without corrections. The thesis is not yet open access due to ongoing publication plans but excerpts can be requested.</p>

                <p>“Creative translation” establishes an epistemological orientation for the creative practice as research and is followed by three case studies. “Breathing worlds” proceeds to explore media artworks in contexts of COVID-19 and urban air pollution in the UK, fomenting a discussion on intersectional politics, antiracist feminisms, and the right to breathable air. “Re-sensing toxicity” engages with exhibition design to deepen the critical reflection on intersectional exposures, with a focus on sprayed pesticides and exploitative labour conditions in Andalusia. Finally, “Drifting with dust” investigates transcontinental, postcolonial experiences of air quality with a dialogue between climatology and critical theory that speculatively “follows” Saharan dust across disciplines and continents. In sum, the research underscores the urgent need for approaches to air quality that account for systemic inequities as well as possibilities to imagine and breathe more hopeful futures into being.
