            <p><i>In the Air</i> is a creative communication project in collaboration with my PhD supervisor, Andrew Barry. For this project, we developed a system of exchanging postcards to communicate our experiences of air and breathing. I designed the postcards with found and fabricated objects that symbolised local, embodied, or domestic atmospheric conditions.</p>
            <p> The choice of mail art as a medium was partly inspired by the process art of the 1960s whereby art objects were replaced with participatory and kinetic components or relics of past activities. Throughout the 20th and into the 21st Century, mail art became a grass-roots practice of decentralisation, of continuing to make art despite a lack of funding or access to studio and gallery spaces (or during global pandemics!).</p>
            <p> Mail art intrigued me as a creative method because it translates personal experiences into words and images that travel across space and time. The postcard in particular suggested a modality for sampling and storying experiences of air and breathing, given its historical association with communicating weather and sense experiences.</p>
            <p>The project had a few limitations. There were only two participants, the correspondence window was brief, and the modes of engagement were entirely remote owing to the pandemic. At the same time, <i>In the Air</i> serves as a prototype for future creative research. We shared all these points and more during a <a href=https://mediacentral.ucl.ac.uk/Play/63476 target=“_blank”> presentation and Q and A</a> at the Alternative Epistemologies Festival in May 2021.</p>
