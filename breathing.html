            <p>Modern Art Oxford (MAO) is Oxford’s leading modern art gallery with a vested interest in its timely exhibition schedule and engaging public programme. As Creative Associate (Digital), I worked with the gallery’s curators and development team to secure funding from The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH) for a creative initiative entitled <i>Breathing Worlds</i>. Building on the success of <a href="breathworks.html">Breathworks</a>, <i>Breathing Worlds</i> would entail collaboration with Professor Derek McCormack whose research centres on cultural geographies of air and atmospheres. We were successful in obtaining funding from TORCH to produce two research-based exhibits at the gallery and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jqVn2iO3J0" target="_blank">two panel events</a>.</p>
            <p>The research-based exhibits were designed as part of the Responsive Space exhibition at MAO (2 October – 23 December 2020 and extended online until 2 May 2021). The exhibition showcased the work of three socially engaged projects at the gallery. In our contribution, we wanted to bring research on breathing to a wider public in visual, spatial, and relatable ways. The first exhibit was a wall-mounted collage measuring 7m at its widest point and 3m at its highest. The collage was composed of quotations and images that we hand-picked and arranged according to themes of environment, politics, culture, and health. In addition, we co-curated a vitrine, positioned in the entrance to the gallery, with relevant books and objects from face masks to spirometers.</p>
            <p>To accompany the exhibition design, we organised two panel events with researchers, activists, and artists as part of the gallery’s public programme. The first, <i>Breathing Worlds</i>, delivered on 13 October 2020, convened Alice Sharp, Artistic Director of Invisible Dust; Patsy Isles, yoga teacher, activist, and Wellbeing Associate at Words of Colour; Derek McCormack, Professor of Cultural Geography at The University of Oxford; and Lucy Sabin, Creative Associate (Digital). The second, <i>Space In/Between</i>, on 20 October 2020 featured speakers Orit Gat, writer; Maral Pourkazemi, design activist; and Dr. Francesca Sobande, lecturer in digital media studies, on the subject of care and community online.</p>
            <p>Both events were streamed in partnership with TORCH and attracted a live audience of 286 with 493 subsequent viewings (as of January 2021). The exhibition received 3,574 visitors and a further 2,155 visits to the virtual exhibition. <i>Breathing worlds</i> helped to instigate a new, interdisciplinary partnership between the gallery and the university and spark conversations about future collaborations. For example, an audience member inquired about bringing <i>Breathworks</i> to young people, which led to the design and development of an activity pack for teachers, <i>My Friend the Sea</i>, in partnership with Oxford Kindness Wave for Children’s Mental Health Awareness Week.</p>
            <p>There were some lessons and limitations faced throughout the research collaboration, many of them connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. First, funding sources had been affected by the financial uncertainty at the time so there was a sense of trying to do more with less. Second, the exhibition design needed to be sparser than initially conceived, to encourage people to flow through the space and maintain social distancing, as per government guidelines. Third, the opening of the exhibition was precipitated by a further lockdown to slowly re-open at a limited capacity. The project continued to reach audiences online in a different way; a 3D scan with clickable labels was commissioned and uploaded to the gallery’s website.</p>
            <p>Finally, <i>Breathing Worlds</i> reached academic audiences through the panel event and subsequent peer-reviewed publication with McCormack published in <i>Venti Journal</i> (<a href="https://www.venti-journal.com/mccormack-and-sabin" target="_blank">2021</a>):
            <blockquote>“Breathing worlds as both noun and verb. As worlds that breathe. Worlds that were breathed into being by others. These worlds are the backgrounds that are foregrounded, only sometimes intentionally, at every inhalation and exhalation.”</blockquote>
