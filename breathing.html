            <blockquote>“Breathing worlds as both noun and verb. As worlds that breathe. Worlds that were breathed into being by others. These worlds are the backgrounds that are foregrounded, only sometimes intentionally, at every inhalation and exhalation.” – McCormack and Sabin (<a href="https://www.venti-journal.com/mccormack-and-sabin" target="_blank">2021</a>)</blockquote>
            <p>Modern Art Oxford (MAO) is Oxford’s leading modern art gallery with a vested interest in its forward-thinking exhibition schedule and public programme. As Creative Associate (Digital), I worked with the curatorial team and cultural geographer Derek McCormack on an artistic research project entitled <i>Breathing Worlds</i>. Building on the success of <a href="breathworks.html">Breathworks</a>, <i>Breathing Worlds</i> entailed  two research-based exhibits at MAO and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jqVn2iO3J0" target="_blank">two panel events</a>.</p>
            <p>The research-based exhibits were designed as part of the Responsive Space exhibition (2 October – 23 December 2020 and extended online until 2 May 2021). In our contribution, we wanted to bring research on breathing to a wider public in visual, spatial, and relatable ways. The first exhibit was a wall-mounted collage measuring 7m at its widest point and 3m at its highest. The collage was composed of quotations and images that we hand-picked and arranged according to themes of environment, politics, culture, and health. In addition, we co-curated a vitrine, positioned in the entrance to the gallery, with relevant books and objects from face masks to spirometers.</p>
<!--
            <p>To accompany the exhibition design, we organised two panel events with researchers, activists, and artists as part of the gallery’s public programme. The first, <i>Breathing Worlds</i>, delivered on 13 October 2020, convened Alice Sharp, Artistic Director of Invisible Dust; Patsy Isles, yoga teacher, activist, and Wellbeing Associate at Words of Colour; Derek McCormack, Professor of Cultural Geography at The University of Oxford; and Lucy Sabin, Creative Associate (Digital). The second, <i>Space In/Between</i>, on 20 October 2020 featured speakers Orit Gat, writer; Maral Pourkazemi, design activist; and Dr. Francesca Sobande, lecturer in digital media studies, on the subject of care and community online.</p>
            <p>Both events were streamed in partnership with TORCH and attracted a live audience of 286 with 493 subsequent viewings (as of January 2021). The exhibition received 3,574 visitors and a further 2,155 visits to the virtual exhibition. 
-->
            <p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was impacted by gallery closures and funding cuts. Nevertheless, <i>Breathing worlds</i> helped to instigate a new, interdisciplinary partnership between MAO and the University of Oxford. The public engagement aspects also sparked conversations leading to sustained partnerships. For example, an audience member enquired about activities for young people. The suggestion led to the design and development of a teaching toolkit, <i>My Friend the Sea</i>, in partnership with Oxford Kindness Wave for Children’s Mental Health Awareness Week.</p>
