                <h1 id="about-lucy">Dr Lucy Sabin</h1>                
                <p>Lucy Sabin is a British artist-researcher with a radically interdisciplinary background spanning geography, feminist science studies, and environmental justice. In her creative practice, she combines graphic (web) design, participatory arts, installation design, art-science collaboration, and somatic practices. Her <a href="./phd.html">PhD <i>Aerography</i></a> (literally, to draw or write the air) is a critical and creative meditation on the concept of air quality. For her postdoctoral research with RE4GREEN at Amsterdam UMC, she is researching perceptions of environmental and climate ethics in science and innovation, which involves developing a podcast and co-ordinating a filmmaking residency. Sabin is co-editor of <i>Chemical Exposures</i> (UCL Press, forth.) and is co-creating an online "chemical atlas" with fellow artists and social scientists at UCL. She has held teaching posts in media, culture, and design at University of Sussex, the University for the Creative Arts, and Arts University Bournemouth.<br>                    
                    
                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Born in 1993 in Chichester, UK to yoga teacher Kate Sabin and sustainability entrepreneur Richard Sabin, Lucy attended her local comprehensive school where she adopted an independent and curiosity-driven approach to her studies. For her undergraduate, Lucy read French, Spanish and Philosophy at the University of Durham and received a Vice Chancellor’s Scholarship for Academic Excellence. She studied Fine Art at the Universidad de Vigo as an exchange student and became Editor of Art & Photography for a student-led publication. After graduating with First-Class Honours, Lucy moved to London to work in communications and website design while teaching yoga on the side. She did this for several years before enrolling in a research-led master’s in communication design at the Royal College of Art. Her dissertation 'Atmospheric cartography: Articulating ecological connectivity in air' passed with distinction and her sound art piece “In memory of air” featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme, Art of Now.</p>
                <p>In 2020, Lucy was named Creative Associate (Digital) at Modern Art Oxford, where she coordinated and curated the participatory arts project Breathworks culminating in a hybrid exhibition and art-research collaboration with the University of Oxford via the Humanities Cultural Programme. Like many people, her living situation and ability to continue producing face-to-face work was deeply impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Fortunately, during these uncertain times, Lucy was able to commence an AHRC-funded PhD with the UCL Department of Geography and Slade School of Fine Art at University College London under the joint supervision of Professor Andrew Barry and Professor Joy Sleeman, which involved working remotely in the first one to two years due to national quarantines. During this time, she experimented with new artistic media, from audiograms to mail art, sometimes creating installations on her bathroom wall. Lucy’s art-research project ‘Imag(in)ing suspension’, which spoke to the atmospheric imaginary of Covid, was selected for a ‘Developing Your Creative Practice Award’ from Arts Council England.</p>
                <p>In recent years, Lucy has come to specialise in creative collaborations across disciplines that grapple with environmental politics and local experiences of (air) pollution. In 2022, she joined a team at the University of Bern for an art-science ‘mLAB residency’ on the theme of sprayed pesticides and intensive agriculture, drawing on fieldwork in Huelva, Andalusia. During the residency, Lucy co-designed a departmental events programme and produced her first solo exhibition featuring an immersive installation. Lucy views her artistic process as a form of open-ended dialogue and not just with human collaborators (communities, citizen scientists, climatologists, soil scientists, social scientists, political geographers, etc.) but also with materials, landscapes, and even weather events. It is through these encounters that Lucy seeks to generate reflexive and polyvocal spaces for contemplating body-world relations with an ethics of enchantment and care. As she writes in her practice-related PhD thesis, Aerography: Air quality and creative practice, “I would not be able to distinguish neatly between living creatively and producing artistic works”.</p>
                <p>After submitting her PhD, Lucy worked as a postdoctoral researcher for a fixed term at the University of Sheffield’s Information School, where she investigated the role of digital, participatory, and performance-based arts in facilitating public debates about AI. Later in 2024, Lucy moved to the Netherlands and started working as a postdoctoral researcher with the Horizon-funded project RE4GREEN in the Department of Ethics, Law and Humanities at Amsterdam UMC. With RE4GREEN, Lucy is researching perceptions of environmental justice in science and innovation, which involves developing a podcast and co-ordinating a filmmaking residency. She is also contributing as co-editor to the forthcoming anthology, Chemical Exposures, to be published with UCL Press. In continuation, she is part of a core team based at UCL who are designing and developing a multimedia ‘Chemical Atlas’ with case studies that foreground local experiences of pollution sourced from a global network of environmental activists and researchers. Lucy remains committed to her deep interests in art-science, atmospheres, breathing, care, feminisms, environmental relations, and living creatively. <i>Last updated November 15, 2024.</i></p>
