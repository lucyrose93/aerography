                <p>Air quality refers to ways of valuing air and comparing levels of air pollution, a major threat to health worldwide. Normally, air quality implies numerical measurements of pollutants, from gases to particles, which are then compared with limit values set by governments. Limit values do important things in terms of monitoring and managing the problem of air pollution. And yet, numbers alone cannot capture the diverse and often accumulative impacts of atmospheric conditions on individuals and communities. In other words, (air) quality is more than quantitative.</p>
                <p>This PhD entails creative research and place-based studies with multiple stakeholders to investigate qualitative approaches to air quality. The intention is not to dismiss numerical thresholds or invent an alternative system, but to expand on existing understandings by prioritising <i>experiences of breathing</i>. Empirically, <i>Aerography</i> seeks to identify, curate, and design spaces in which communities can voice and reflect on lived experiences of air quality and shared atmospheres. Inspired by design research, <i>Aerography</i> critically engages with environmental communication through interdisciplinary dialogues, stakeholder engagement, and creative encounters.

                <p>
                <p>This project focusses on lived experiences of air. I argue that situated research on air quality has been overlooked in comparison to numerical thresholds. Embodied accounts of air could bring additional insights as to the meaning of ‘quality’ in this context. This research asks questions like, <i>What is it like</i> for this person to breathe in this atmosphere?</p>
                <p>The research is also creative. From exhibitions and experience design to experimental modes of communication, I focus on creative processes as a means of sensitising audiences and participants to a more relational view of air quality. The creative work strives to produce interfaces and interactions for sensing and articulating the circumstances in which air quality matters in situ.</p>
                <p>What is more, creative methods have value beyond the results they produce. Creative encounters can be emotional, interactive, and impactful. For example, a participatory arts project can engage diverse communities, give voice to marginalised perspectives, mobilise an ethics of care, and spark debate.</p>

                <p> Aerography is an emerging realm of theories and practices for making air, atmospheres, and breathing palpable, personal, poetic, or perhaps political. Once a field of atmospheric science in the early 1900s, the term ‘aerography’ has in recent years been revived by researchers spanning multiple disciplines across the arts and humanities.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1068/d2903ed" target="_blank">[3]</a> Aerographers study atmospheric conditions in relation to social, cultural, and historical phenomena. Broadly speaking, aerography implies the possibility of writing the air as opposed to the earth in geography. The <i>aero-</i> here may refer to aesthetic and material qualities of the air as well as the experience of being immersed in an atmosphere. While the <i>graphia</i> or writing action refers to processes for transcribing, narrating, or sounding said qualities and experiences.</p>

                <p>This PhD project was completed as part of the Geography (practice-related) programme at University College London. The first year of the PhD, 2020, was deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. People became more concerned about air pollution and breathlessness on an individual and societal level. The possibility of fieldwork abroad or participatory research became uncertain. The empirical research of this thesis unfolded during quarantine periods and as quarantines lifted. I co-created an online exhibition with Modern Art Oxford on the theme of breathing, I designed an immersive exhibition at the University of Bern in response to sprayed pesticides, and I initiated a creative collaboration on the topic of Saharan dust. Each case study situates concerns about air pollution within a political, cultural, and social context. In my creative research, I focus not only on narratives of harm but also possibilities to imagine and enact more hopeful futures.</p>

                <p>I'm an interdisciplinary researcher based in Amsterdam and London with a background in communication design. My research interests include human-environment relations, environmental (air) quality, interdisciplinary collaboration, intersectional feminisms, and science communication. I care about engaging and empowering diverse audiences and stakeholders on environmental and social issues.</p>
                <p>In my work, I explore ecological relations from forgotten or underrepresented perspectives. My core competencies include arts collaborations, design thinking, mixed methods research, writing and editing, participatory methods, and communication. I have successfully applied these skills to research proposals, educational resources, international projects, peer-reviewed publications, grant applications, and public engagement initiatives.</p>
                <p>My PhD is based in the UCL Department of Geography under the supervision of Andrew Barry and Joy Sleeman. I have an master's degree in Communication Design from the Royal College of Art and previously held teaching posts at the University of Sussex, the University for the Creative Arts, and Arts University Bournemouth. In 2020, I was appointed Creative Associate (Digital) of Modern Art Oxford and received a DYCP Award from Arts Council England in 2021. My first solo exhibition took place at the University of Bern in May 2022.</p><br>
