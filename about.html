                <p>My interests distill into atmosphere, breath, and weather; digital storytelling and art-science collaboration; feminisms and embodied sensing. I combine studies of culture and environment with media arts, drawing on my training in geography (PhD), communication design (MRes), and web development. My work speaks to the environmental humanities, and is defined by epistemic diversity and creative inquiry. The timeline below captures key developments in my research and practice over the last few years.</p>
                <p><b>2025-</b> Within the EU-funded <a href="https://chanse.org/ruralex/" target="_blank">RURALEX</a> project, I am collaborating with scientist and musician Alice Eldridge at the University of Sussex to research experiences of <i>rewilding landscapes</i>. I will combine qualitative research in the field (walking interviews) with arts-based methods and deep mapping to gather local knowledges and multispecies stories.</p>
                <p><b>2024-25</b> As Postdoctoral Researcher at Amsterdam UMC with the EU project RE4GREEN, I co-created a toolkit and competence framework on ecologically just approaches to research and innovation. I produced the podcast <a href="./earthresearch.html"><i>Earth to Research</i></a>, and started the EcoFeministArtScience (<a href="https://easst.net/fund/easst-fund-supports-ecofeminist-art-science-efas-residency/" target="_blank">EFAS</a>) Collective, while also co-editeding the forthcoming UCL Press anthology <em>Chemical Exposures: Toxicity in the Anthropocene</em>.</p>
                <p><b>2020-2024</b> I completed my PhD in the Department of Geography at UCL, funded by the AHRC. My project, <a href="./phd.html"><i>Aerography</i></a>, explored lived experiences of air pollution through collaborative and arts-based research, with case studies spanning urban, agricultural, and coastal settings. Alongside my thesis and peer-reviewed publications, I submitted a portfolio of creative work. Highlights included a <a href="./exposicion.html">solo exhibition</a> at the University of Bern.</p>
                <p><b>2020-21</b> The year I spent as Creative Associate (Digital) at Modern Art Oxford, working closely with the curatorial team, helped defined my approach to artistic research. I led the participatory project <a href="./breathworks.html"><i>Breathworks</i></a>, supported by The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities, received a DYCP Award from Arts Council England, and appeared on <i>BBC Art of Now</i>. I also co-taught MA Graphic Design at Arts University Bournemouth.
                <p><b>2018-20</b> I completed a Master of Research (MRes) in Communication Design at the Royal College of Art on the speculative topic of <a href="atmos.html">atmospheric cartography</a> which involved participatory workshops and practitioner interviews. I directed my skills in digital design towards accessible and impactful forms of storytelling, while also drawing on my facilitation experience as a part-time yoga teacher.</p>
