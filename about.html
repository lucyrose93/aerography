                <h1 id="about-lucy">Dr Lucy Sabin</h1>
                <p>I'm a cultural geographer and artistic researcher with a background in communication design. My research interests include atmospheres and breathing, ecological justice, and intersectional feminisms. In 2024, I completed a practice-related PhD in Geography at University College London, funded by the London Arts and Humanities Partnership. <a href="./phd.html"><i>Aerography</i></a> explores situated experiences of air pollution through interdisciplinary and arts-based research, with case studies in urban, agricultural, and coastal environments. I created a solo exhibition at the University of Bern and published in major peer-reviewed journals.<br><br>In September 2024, I joined the Department of Ethics, Law and Humanities at Amsterdam UMC. Embedded in the EU-funded project RE4GREEN, I'm responsible for leading the design of multimedia learning resources on environmentally aware research. I produce the podcast <i>Earth to Research!</i> (launching next semester), and co-edit the anthology <em>Chemical Exposures: Toxicity in the Anthropocene</em> (forth., with UCL Press). I have held teaching posts in design, media, and culture at University of Sussex, the University for the Creative Arts, and Arts University Bournemouth. You are welcome to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a> about guest lecturing, collaborations, commissions, or licensing my images for your next event or publication.
