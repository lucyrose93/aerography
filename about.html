            <div class="summary_text">
                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Links between air pollution and poor health experiences are increasingly backed by empirical evidence. Worldwide, over nine in ten people breathe polluted air, state the World Health Organisation.<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-05-2018-9-out-of-10-people-worldwide-breathe-polluted-air-but-more-countries-are-taking-action" target="_blank">[1]</a> The WHO base this assessment on their guideline levels for air quality: 'a set of evidence-based recommendations of limit values for specific air pollutants' like particulate matter.<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>
                <p>Limit values do important things like flagging risk areas, demonstrating the global scale of the problem, and indicating sources of pollution. Yet limit values also have limitations when it comes to understanding air quality in context. First, the values are fungible and tend to lag behind WHO standards. Second, they systematically permit a background level of pollution. Third, they are less equipped to measure the accumulative effects of multiple exposures on vulnerable groups.</p>
                <p>This PhD investigates air and its qualities in situated and creative ways, working with, between, and beyond numerical data. The provocation being, might we also think about air quality as a dynamic relationship between bodies, places, and their atmospheres? Given the uneven distribution of air pollution and the complexity of the issue, the objective of this PhD is not to reject numerical thresholds or invent an alternative index.</p>
                <p><a href="works.html">Art and design processes</a> are deployed throughout <i>Aerography</i> as a site-specific form of critical engagement with communities, labourers, climatologists, hardware, software, analysts, creatives, students, non-human species, and matter. The objective is to identify, curate, and design spaces in which communities can voice and reflect on lived experiences of air quality and shared atmospheres, thus complementing and expanding existing framings of air quality. The case studies in <i>Aerography</i> situate air quality with respect to historical inequities as well as possibilities to breathe more hopeful futures into being.</p>

                <h2>Why qualitative and creative research?</h2>
                <p>
                <p>This project focusses on lived experiences of air. I argue that situated research on air quality has been overlooked in comparison to numerical thresholds. Embodied accounts of air could bring additional insights as to the meaning of ‘quality’ in this context. This research asks questions like, <i>What is it like</i> for this person to breathe in this atmosphere?</p>
                <p>The research is also creative. From exhibitions and experience design to experimental modes of communication, I focus on creative processes as a means of sensitising audiences and participants to a more relational view of air quality. The creative work strives to produce interfaces and interactions for sensing and articulating the circumstances in which air quality matters in situ.</p>
                <p>What is more, creative methods have value beyond the results they produce. Creative encounters can be emotional, interactive, and impactful. For example, a participatory arts project can engage diverse communities, give voice to marginalised perspectives, mobilise an ethics of care, and spark debate.</p>

                <h2>Why aerography?</h2>
                <p> Aerography is an emerging realm of theories and practices for making air, atmospheres, and breathing palpable, personal, poetic, or perhaps political. Once a field of atmospheric science in the early 1900s, the term ‘aerography’ has in recent years been revived by researchers spanning multiple disciplines across the arts and humanities.<a href="https://doi.org/10.1068/d2903ed" target="_blank">[3]</a> Aerographers study atmospheric conditions in relation to social, cultural, and historical phenomena. Broadly speaking, aerography implies the possibility of writing the air as opposed to the earth in geography. The <i>aero-</i> here may refer to aesthetic and material qualities of the air as well as the experience of being immersed in an atmosphere. While the <i>graphia</i> or writing action refers to processes for transcribing, narrating, or sounding said qualities and experiences.</p>

                <a href="./imgs/map-research.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="imgs/map-research.jpg" class="about_funding_img"></a>
                <p>This PhD project was completed as part of the Geography (practice-related) programme at University College London. The first year of the PhD, 2020, was deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. People became more concerned about air pollution and breathlessness on an individual and societal level. The possibility of fieldwork abroad or participatory research became uncertain. The empirical research of this thesis unfolded during quarantine periods and as quarantines lifted. I co-created an online exhibition with Modern Art Oxford on the theme of breathing, I designed an immersive exhibition at the University of Bern in response to sprayed pesticides, and I initiated a creative collaboration on the topic of Saharan dust. Each case study situates concerns about air pollution within a political, cultural, and social context. In my creative research, I focus not only on narratives of harm but also possibilities to imagine and enact more hopeful futures.</p>

                <h1>About Lucy</h1>
                <p>I am a multidisciplinary researcher and designer based in Brighton and London. I have five years of experience in exploring creative approaches to air quality as a postgraduate researcher. My core competencies include research, writing, collaboration, participatory methods, and creative communication. I have successfully applied these skills to grant applications, lecturing, research proposals, international projects, peer-reviewed publications, and public engagement initiatives.</p>
                <p>I care about engaging and empowering diverse audiences and stakeholders on environmental and social issues. My work explores ecological relations from forgotten or underrepresented perspectives. Research interests span atmospheres and breathing, sensing and aesthetics, interdisciplinary collaboration, and media theory-practice: participatory arts, experience design, and digital design. I am also a yoga teacher and often bring somatic techniques into design research.</p>
                <p>I am completing an AHRC-funded PhD in Geography with creative practice at UCL under the supervision of Andrew Barry and Joy Sleeman. I hold an MRes in Communication from the Royal College of Art and have been a visiting lecturer in film, media, and graphic design at the University of Sussex, the University for the Creative Arts, and Arts University Bournemouth. In 2020, I was appointed Creative Associate (Digital) of Modern Art Oxford and received a DYCP Award from Arts Council England in 2021. My first solo exhibition took place at the University of Bern in May 2022.</p><br>
