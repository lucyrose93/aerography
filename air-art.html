            <p>In art history, much has been said about earth art and land art. These terms correspond to creative practices of the late 1960s that involved transforming the landscape itself into an artwork. In contrast, art about air and atmospheres has received less attention as a thematic genre despite numerous precedents, notwithstanding an exhibition entitled “Air Art” (1968-9) curated by Willoughby Sharp, featuring works by Andy Warhol and Hans Haacke among others.</p>
            <p><span class=“highlight”>For artists, designers, and architects making work about air pollution and climate change today, there is no concise keyword or search term to which we can refer besides ‘environmental art’</span>. It was vital to redress this imbalance as part of my research on how creative methods can generate novel understandings of air quality. So, one of the first questions I asked myself was, which aesthetic techniques have been developed over time for making qualities of air perceptible?</p>
            <p>To answer this question, I set myself the challenging of visualising and sketching what a revisionist history of ‘air art’ would look like. This history would contextualise and enhance my PhD thesis as a visual and experimental part of the literature review. Air art would inspire my creative projects and perhaps inform research and development for future exhibitions or events on the topic, should the right outlet present itself.</p>
            <p>My method has involved reading between the lines of selected art history books, online archives, and exhibition catalogues to join the dots. I have selected examples of artworks that could be gathered into a collection marking the emergence of air art in the long 1960s. My speculative collection of air art encompasses contributions from Richard Long, Alice Aycock, Yoko Ono, Piero Manzoni, Graham Stevens, and David medulla, among others.</p>
            <p>I discovered that ideas about process, kineticism, conceptualism, and spatiality that circulated in the late 1960s and 70s are equally connected with ideas of flight, weather, atmosphere, and breath – perhaps in conjunction with the growth of mainstream air travel and concerns about nuclear. To bring some coherency to the proposed history, I propose four throughlines for air art: clouds and skies, performance and flight, pneumatics, and mobilities and traces.</p>
